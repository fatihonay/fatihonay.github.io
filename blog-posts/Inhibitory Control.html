The journey of life has begun about 4 billion years ago. Since the simplest life form emerged, life has always been shaped by environmental factors. This provided diversity and the birth of different life forms. One of these life forms exceptionally represented a very high capability of intelligence that makes it possible to change our world dramatically.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
Yes, indeed! This is us or our brains.
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>

                        <p>
As modern humans, we can easily accept the idea of being the superior species due to the developed technology, art, and literature, while the remaining life forms just live to survive. Ask yourself this question and think about the answer; if you can do it;
When was the last time you were afraid of dying due to the risk of starvation?                
                      </p>

                    <p>
Indeed, this is no longer an issue for modern humans. This is why we developed tech, math, physics, philosophy, and other numerous fields of science. Because our agenda shifted from primitive issues to solving the problems of mysteries of our universe. But this was different for our ancestors. This line between humans and nature was not thick and prominent. So, I asked myself how things changed during history and how our species constructed culture and civilization.                    </p>
                    <p>

                    <p>
There were some reasons that provided an advantage for us to create such extraordinary civilizations;
    <ul>
        <li>A higher ratio of brain/body</li>
        <li>Using fire to warm and cook</li>
        <li>Using hands to craft valuable tools</li>
        <li>Living in groups and collaborative societies</li>
        <li>Language</li>
        <li>Invention of writing</li>
    </ul>
                    <p>

                        <p>
            Beyond these factors, something important related to our ancestors’ behavior caught my attention. At some point in history, the attitude toward death changed, and the burials gained a spiritual identity. We don’t know the exact time of this change of attitude, but it took place around 30,000 years ago. The conception of death as a spiritual event indicates important patterns of mindset, such as;
        </p>

        <!-- The second list of mindset patterns -->
        <ul>
            <li>Self – awareness</li>
            <li>Belief in afterlife</li>
            <li>Abstract thinking</li>
            <li>Social norms</li>
            <li>Developing art</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Although the fundamental reasons remain unclear, humans have long believed that burial is a significant practice. This belief has led to the development of various social norms and rituals. One of the most extreme examples of this is the Egyptian pyramids, which were constructed as monumental tombs for the deceased.
        </p>

        <p>
            I believe that ancient humans initially developed a belief in the afterlife. This belief subsequently led to the development of rituals, art, and social interactions, which in turn contributed to the emergence of strong religious systems that addressed concerns about life after death.
